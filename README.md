The idea is that you can visually select an UI element from screen using the mouse and then choose from a variety of actions you can do on the selected element (like click, set text, check and so on). More, you can add conditions in the task flow based on properties of UI elements. Also, you can repeat a part of the task while a condition is true or for a specified number of times using loops.
